# I'm Eric Paquin

I believe it often takes bold moves to achieve business, and personal, success. But being bold is not sufficient, you need to understand the problem you want to solve, support your decision with data and, yes, sometimes, trust your gut instinct.

## I'm not perfect. I'm a work in progress.

If I can help you find this one innovation in your organisation that will help you grow, I would be delighted. And closer to an ideal where I  can share my knowledge with your organisation so that you can sustain a culture of innovation on your own.

This site will keep growing to include my professional and personal musings. From talks to interests, business models to photography.

This is me.
